# 🛰️ Mini-Netumo - Website Monitoring System

> **Capstone Project - CS 421: Application Deployment and Management**
> **The University of Dodoma** — College of Informatics and Virtual Education
> **Instructor:** Dr. Goodiel C. Moshi
> **Submission Date:** 7th June 2025
> **Developed by:** Group 13

---

## 📚 Project Overview

**Mini-Netumo** is a lightweight, open-source website monitoring system inspired by commercial tools like Netumo. It is designed to:

* Continuously monitor website uptime and response latency.
* Check SSL certificate and domain registration validity.
* Notify users via email or webhook when issues are detected.

This project demonstrates real-world deployment of microservices using DevOps best practices, containerization, and CI/CD, as required by the CS 421 Capstone Project.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* ✅ Schedule periodic HTTP/HTTPS checks for registered targets.
* ✅ Log response status codes, latency, and failure timestamps.
* ✅ Perform daily SSL and WHOIS checks.
* ✅ Notify users of downtime or expiring certificates/domains.
* ✅ Provide a user-friendly frontend dashboard.
* ✅ Implement CI/CD pipeline and deploy a live service to AWS.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### 🔧 Backend

* **FastAPI** — Modern async web framework
* **PostgreSQL** — Relational database
* **SQLAlchemy** — ORM
* **Celery + Redis** — Task queue and message broker
* **HTTPX** — Async HTTP client
* **OpenSSL / WHOIS** — Certificate and domain validity checks

### 🎨 Frontend

* **React + TypeScript** — SPA dashboard
